# Automatic repeating earthquake detector.

This code automatically detects repeating earthquakes reported by the Mexican Seismological Service ([SSN]
(https://www.ssn.unam.mx/)). When a new earthqauake is reported through the SSN Twitter Feed, the code looks for nearby
sequences previously reported. In this case, we are using a 22-year catalog from 2001-2022.
